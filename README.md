# Introduction to Programming exercises
This repository contais a few problems that i learn how to solve in University, as a part of the introduction to programming concepts. Those exercices were very important for me to acquire programming skills during the first semester in University. 

Most of the codes were lost when the discipline moodle page closed, in the end of the semester. I didn't save them in my own computer, which means this repository does not represent my total knowledge about C and problems solutions in the programming context.
